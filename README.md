Domain: Travel Industry, Property Management, Tourism

Problem Statement:

This project tackles the analysis of Airbnb data in New York City. We aim to:

Clean and Prepare Data: Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas, retrieve the Airbnb dataset, and perform necessary cleaning (handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types).
Develop Interactive Geospatial Visualizations: Employ Streamlit to create a user-friendly web application featuring interactive maps for exploring Airbnb locations.
Analyze and Visualize Pricing: Uncover pricing trends across locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts to identify price variations, outliers, and correlations with other factors.
Craft a Comprehensive Dashboard: Utilize Tableau to construct a visually compelling dashboard that summarizes key findings. The dashboard will combine various visualizations (maps, charts, tables) to present a holistic view of the Airbnb data and its trends.
Libraries/Modules Used:

Python:
Plotly: Creates interactive and informative plots
Seaborn: Provides a high-level interface for statistical visualization
Pandas: Essential for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
